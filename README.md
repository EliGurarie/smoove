### Overview

The `smoove` package is a collection of functions to work with continuous time correlated velocity movement (CVM) models as described in Gurarie et al. (nearly in press is *Movement Ecology*).   There are functions that simulate, diagnose and estimate these movement models, as well as functions for facilitating a change point analysis.

To install in R:
```
require(devtools)
install_github("EliGurarie/smoove")
```

To see a detailed vignette:
```
