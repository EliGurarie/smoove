Description: a collection of functions to work with continuous time correlated velocity movement (CVM) models as described in Gurarie et al. (nearly in press is *Movement Ecology*).   There are functions that simulate, diagnose and estimate these movement models, as well as functions for facilitating a change point analysis.
